# About
A meta repository for discussion, planning, and documentation of this organization

## LowResouceLanguages

This GitHub organization was created:
	- To provide a place for people to upload projects related to low resource language that they do not want on their personal or institutional accounts;
	- To mirror code hosted on other sites, such as SourceForge or institutional or personal websites, where the longevity of the web hosting is not sure and hosting it here ensures that it will have a place to stay;
	- To fork projects on GitHub that may be in danger of being removed or becoming stale due to lack of community effort.

## FAQ

*I've been invited and I'm not sure why.*

We invited a fair amount of people who work on low resource languages to this organization; your membership is not public unless you choose to make it so. We hope that you contribute by hosting any code that you do not have on a GitHub repository already in this organization, fork any projects you find particularly useful, and jump into discussions in the GitHub issues for this repository. Membership does not mean you have to do anything, though!

*Couldn't forking or mirroring old code result in a lot of stale code?*

It might, but we think that stale code is better than losing code (or data, or repositories).

*What about licensing?*

Code here should always include a license, and should be in the public domain.

*Where is the line for what constitutes useful for endangered language revitalization and not just field linguists? Does any computer language repository count?*

If you're unsure about something, open an issue here and we can talk about it. For now, use your own discretion.


## Best practices for project maintainers

This section describes what you can do as a LRL project maintainer to help others find your project, and maybe even help you maintain it.

### Publish your package

If you are building something that might be interesting to other low resource language developers we reccomend you:

* Publish your package with the appropriate package manager for your framework/technology/programming language, if you know how to do this.
* Add the keyword/tag "LRL" to your project so that other developers can find it more easily.


### Prominately display the link/badge to your published package

If you want to add a link to the package manager of the project (where developers usually download code), you can use a badge for NPM/PyPI/Gems/SourceForge/Maven among [others](http://shields.io) to your README.md

Adding a badge showing the downloads can help list users discover that others are using your project (keep in mind that number of downloads for a low resource language doesn't really mattter, so the more downloads doesn't necessarily mean that the package will be more useful for the next developer).
