# Measurements of visibility


In this study we will endevour to increase the visibility of LRL codebases on GitHub. We hyptheizse that making GitHub stargazers a more visually prominate feature of the list will lead to more stars on the projects.

# Methodology

1. Add star stats for all GitHub projects in the list
1. Measure the star stats baseline (before star stats were added)
1. Measure the star stats periodically to detect changes


## Measurement Methodology

Use the GitHub public API to download JSON stats for projects which are in the list.

# Results

# Base line control

Measurement taken using the [measure_visibility.sh](measure_visibility.sh) script on Sunday August 2 2015.
